# NLP-with-Disaster-Tweets_Kaggle-Competition
## The main idea of this project is predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not, using NLP Techniques and Machine Learning. The dataset consists of around 10,000 tweets.
## Bernoulli Naive Bayes model gave better Accuracy of 0.82 and AU-ROC score of 0.866 on Train data when compared to others.
## Hence this model is used for predicting test set. Accuracy obtained on test data is 0.792
